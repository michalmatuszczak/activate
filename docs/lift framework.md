# LIFT FRAMEWORK #
The “**activate-lift**” module has the EntityForm that provides a easy way to handle lift entity forms. It is basically an EntityMap that translates invariant violation exceptions to the InvalidForm exception.

The default [EntityForm](http://activate-framework.org/documentation/entity/#entity_map) is immutable and there is the MutableEntityForm as an alternative:

net.fwbrasil.activate.lift.EntityForm

net.fwbrasil.activate.lift.MutableEntityForm
